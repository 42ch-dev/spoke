# Concepts — SPOKE Domain Vocabulary

Core terms for the SPOKE protocol repository. Each entry defines what the term means *in SPOKE wire form*, not inside any single product runtime.

**Product name:** **SPOKE** = **Standardized Programmable Ontology Knowledge Engine** (acronym unchanged).

---

## Protocol layer

### KnowledgeEntry

The atomic **Knowledge Base entry** on the SPOKE wire (L0–L1). A KnowledgeEntry has stable identity (`knowledge_entry_id`), open-string `entry_type` and `status`, a structured `body`, optional provenance (`source_anchor`), and required `extensions`. Core `status` vocabulary: `provisional`, `confirmed`, `deprecated`, `merged`, `deleted` — cross-product transitions enforced by `@42ch/spoke-operations` (operations library deepen); `deprecated` → `merged` is excluded (restore to `confirmed` before absorb). Products map their local KB entities to KnowledgeEntries via adapters (adapter work next iteration).

**Pre-1.0 wire rename:** retired legacy wire name; no dual aliases.

### Relation

A directed edge between two KnowledgeEntries (or KnowledgeEntry ↔ source) identified by `relation_id` and open-string `relation_type`.

### SourceAnchor

A pointer to a source artifact span (manuscript, scene, external locator). Ties KnowledgeEntries and Findings to provenance without embedding product file paths in protocol fields.

### Finding

Checker **output** — consistency, style, structure, or other analysis results. Not a KnowledgeEntry body and not a declarative rule definition.

### Rule

Declarative constraint **input** to `check` (L6). First-class wire object — `schemas/data/rule.schema.json` + field tables in [`spoke-data-model.md`](.mstar/specs/spoke-data-model.md). Distinct from Finding (checker output) and from KnowledgeEntry `entry_type` strings products may use for ontology labels.

### TimelineEvent

First-class **when-axis** temporal object (L5) — `schemas/data/timeline-event.schema.json` + field tables in [`spoke-data-model.md`](.mstar/specs/spoke-data-model.md). Optional `timeline_scale` tags the L5 projection tier (`brief`, `narrative`, `moment`). **Distinct from** KnowledgeEntry `entry_type: "event"` (ontology label on a KB entry body).

**Pre-1.0 wire rename:** retired legacy wire name; no dual aliases.

### TimelineScale

L5 Timeline projection tier vocabulary on the wire: core values `brief`, `narrative`, `moment` (open string). Field name **`timeline_scale`** on `TimelineEvent` and optional `Scope` filters. Standardizes Timeline-dimension semantics — not product canvas surface names.

### Scope

Shared ops selector for `check` and `assemble`. Required `scope_id` (protocol-neutral opaque string) plus optional refinements (`knowledge_entry_ids`, `entry_types`, `timeline_event_ids`, `source_id`, `timeline_scale`). World/Book/product ids map via op `extensions` or adapters — not required `Scope` fields.

### Domain Profile

How a product publishes its ontology mapping without closing core protocol enums. Open `entry_type` strings + published vocabulary tables in adapter specs — not closed `enum` in core schemas. See [`spoke-protocol-layers.md`](.mstar/specs/spoke-protocol-layers.md).

### spoke-baseline

Declared capability level for spoke-baseline SPOKE compliance: L0–L8 semantics per [`spoke-protocol-layers.md`](.mstar/specs/spoke-protocol-layers.md) §Baseline — excludes required Fork (`l5-fork`) and L2 computable state (`l2-computable`).

### AssemblePacket

Wire-only context-assembly payload: a list of slim entries (`knowledge_entry_id`, `entry_type`, `canonical_name`, optional `snippet`). Ranking, retrieval, and token budgeting are product-local; see [`spoke-ops.md` §assemble](.mstar/specs/spoke-ops.md#assemble-wire-only-boundary-normative).

### Extensions (`extensions.<namespace>`)

The sole product-specific bag on every data object. Namespace keys are product ids (`nexus`, `creader`, …). Adapters MUST round-trip unknown namespaces and keys verbatim.

## Dual-concern: ontology `"event"` vs TimelineEvent

| Concern | Wire artifact | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Ontology / KB fact** | `KnowledgeEntry` with `entry_type: "event"` | “The Battle of Five Armies” as a typed KB node |
| **Timeline / when-axis** | `TimelineEvent` with `timeline_event_id` | Same story beat placed on the Timeline with `timeline_scale: "narrative"` |

Products may map one local concept to one or both wire shapes. SPOKE keeps the names separate so check/assemble selectors and adapters stay unambiguous.

## Boundaries (what SPOKE is not)

| Term | In SPOKE | Product-local (not redefined here) |
|------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| **KnowledgeEntry** | Portable wire envelope for one KB entry | — |
| **World KB** | Mapped *to* KnowledgeEntries via adapters | Nexus world's structured knowledge store |
| **Author Memory** | May appear under `extensions.<namespace>` | Creator profile, SOUL, session memory pipelines |
| **Rule** | L6 declarative wire object + `check` input | Creader `KnowledgeEntryType: "rule"` mapping in adapters |
| **TimelineEvent / Timeline tiers** | L5 `TimelineEvent` + `timeline_scale` vocabulary | Nexus World/Work Canvas surfaces, carrier UI |
| **Fork** | Optional capability `l5-fork` (not baseline) | Nexus immutable world-history branch semantics |

**Invariant:** SPOKE standardizes interchange shapes. It does not own world history implementation, daemon routes, or checker engines.

## Spelling

| Context | Spelling |
|---------|----------|
| SPOKE protocol / schemas / packages | **KnowledgeEntry**, **TimelineEvent** |
| Nexus product code / UI | **KeyBlock** (product spelling — maps to wire `KnowledgeEntry`) |
| Creader Knowledge Base | **KnowledgeEntry** (same name on wire after terminology iteration) |
| TimelineScale wire values (`timeline_scale` field) | **`brief`**, **`narrative`**, **`moment`** (lowercase) |
| Nexus Timeline surfaces (product UI) | Brief, Narrative, Moment — map to wire values in adapters |
| Ontology label on a KB entry | `entry_type: "event"` (string value — **not** the `TimelineEvent` type) |
